## Overview 

The scientific name of the Orchid is Orchidaceae of the Plantae kingdom. With about 28,000 species and 100,000 hybrids ranging around the world, the Orchid has quite the family. The most common orchid we see in stores today is commonly known as the Moth orchid or the Phalaenopsis, which draws it’s name from it’s butterfly shape. These extravagant plants are native to regions of Asia and Australia, but the popularity of the bloom has created a market for itself in most grocery stores around the country. In fact, the Moth orchid account for 75% of all U.S. orchid sales. The popularity of this bloom isn’t just the elegance of the flower, they are very easy to maintain. The Moth orchids require very little water, in fact, they prefer the bark to be completely dry between waterings. The only real maintenance these flowers require are fertilizing as well as repotting every couple of years. The work around these plants is pretty effortless considering how exotic they look and how long they usually bloom for.  

Each species carries its own characteristics, a bloom can be anywhere from 2mm to 2.5m, and can survive from a few hours to six months depending on the species. As unique as the bloom itself is, the roots are just as elaborate. The root system is not a conventional one, they lack the need of soil and actually prefer to thrive in bark or moss. Besides the basal roots, these plants have adventitious roots. These roots surface from the stem nodes, being that they are above ground  the adventitious roots are able to absorb moisture and nutrients from air. These roots are exposed to sunlight, interestingly enough they hold chloroplast, which gives them the ability to photosynthesize, which is a function usually found in leaves of plants. The brilliance of these plants explains why more and more Phalaenopsis orchid are being sold each year.
